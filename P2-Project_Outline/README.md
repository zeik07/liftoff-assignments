## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a Twitch streamer I have tried and used many different chatbots in order to help automate or simply things while streaming. 
Every chatbot that I have looked at or used has had one major flaw, that flaw is that it never has everything that I am looking for in a single bot.
Most of them that I have used have another major flaw, they include many things that I dont want to use at all and are just sitting there cluttering the interface.

What I am working on doing is making a new Twitch chatbot that answers all of those problems. 
It will provide all the features that are needed for streaming, whether it be me or someone else.
The interface will be modular so that if there is a feature you dont want, you can easily turn it off and it won't even display which will reduce interface clutter.

### Features
User authintication to twitch.tv
A modular design.
The ability to set/change/edit your stream title, communities, and current game.
The ability to read and write in your own chat channel.
The ability to create custom channel commands for viewers of your channel to use.
